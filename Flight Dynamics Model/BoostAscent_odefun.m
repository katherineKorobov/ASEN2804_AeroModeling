function [dSdt] = BoostAscent_odefun(t,S,consts,thrustVec,Time)
% BOOSTASCENT_odefun
% The goal of this function is to output the derivatives of the current
% state (held in the vector 'S'). These derivatives are calculated using
% fundamental physics, and then are packed together in "dSdt'. 
% 
% ODE45 will pass in time information to this function (since the physics
% are time dependentant), and then will numerically integrate the 
% derivative in the output by something like:
%       S(i+1) = S(i) + dSdt*dt 
% where ODE45 is picking dt.
%
% We need information about the position, velocity, and mass, thus these
% are all of the quantities held in the state vector. Also passed in is a
% constants vector that holds information that the will be needed to
% calculate quanties of interest in this funciton. Finally, there is also
% the trust vector and time vector associated with the thrust vector so
% that we can calculate thrust at any given time using interpolation.

%% Sum the forces
% Assume that all forces exept gravity act in (or against) the direction
% that the body is pointing. This means that the force in any component
% direction is the sum of the forces multiplied by the component of the
% unit vector in line with the body pointing (hBod). We then assume that
% gravity acts only in -z.

% Sum of the forces
%Since forces T, D, f_rails are always aligned w/ relative velocity vector (body frame),
%components of force in inertial frame can be found my multiplying sum of magnitude of forces by relative velocity unit vector.
Fx = (T-D-f_rails)*hBod_x; %Sum of forces in x inertial frame

Fz = (T-D-f_rails)*hBod_z + m*g; %Sum of forces in z inertial frame

%% Calculate the derivatives we need to pass out
% Change in postition = Acceleration = F/m (Newtons 2nd Law) - This value
% comes from our physics since the sum of the forces is time dependent
dVdt_x = Fx/m;
dVdt_y = Fy/m;
dVdt_z = Fz/m;

% Now we do some error checking:
% If we are not yet producing enough thrust to get a positive component of
% acceleration while very near the base of the the launcher, this means
% that the rocket is trying to slide backwards down the rails. There is
% backing plate that will stop this from happening, so if this backwards
% motion is detected by the following test, set the acceleration to zero
if sqrt(x^2+y^2+z^2) <= 0.05 && dVdt_z > 0% still on rails
    dVdt_x = 0;
    dVdt_y = 0;
